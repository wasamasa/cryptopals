# Detect AES in ECB mode

[In this file](https://github.com/wasamasa/cryptopals/blob/master/01/08.txt) are a bunch of hex-encoded ciphertexts.

One of them has been encrypted with ECB.

Detect it.

Remember that the problem with ECB is that it is stateless and
deterministic; the same 16 byte plaintext block will always produce
the same 16 byte ciphertext.
